# cpp_test

## Running Unit Tests

This project uses [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) for unit testing. The Makefile will automatically download the Catch2 header if needed.

To build and run the tests:

```bash
make test
```

This will compile the tests and run them, showing the results in your terminal.
